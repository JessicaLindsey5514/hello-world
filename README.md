This repository is for practicing GitHub flow.
Hi! I've been a bartender/server for 15 years. I'm really excited about this program and finding a new passion. Which might be funny to hear, I love working in the service industry... but as I get older I have found i really miss learning about new things and challenging myself. Ultimately, I think the best move for me would be to leave the service industry and find a more stable job, that is hopefully something I am as passionate about as working in the service industry.
